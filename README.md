#Opentokfire

This app is made possible with OpenTok API for live video, and Firebase for scalable and real-time data storage. 
OpenTokFire lets users create rooms to video chat around different topics. Itâ€™s like Google Hangouts without requiring 
users to login to Google. There is a maximum of four videos per room. When the room reaches its capacity, users could 
be added onto a wait-list and still subscribe to the on-going conversation.


## How To Run:
